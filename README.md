# Project 1 - MLP in Tensorflow and PyTorch

Course: Neural Networks @ FIIT STU
Authors: Viktor Modroczký & Michaela Hanková

## Versions

Python 3.7.9 has been used for this project for compatibility reasons.
We used version 2.11.0 of Tensorflow and version 1.13.1 of PyTorch.

## Dataset

We used the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset for this project. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset is available in both libraries.
